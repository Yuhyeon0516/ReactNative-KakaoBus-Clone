# ReactNative-KakaoBus-Clone

I cloned bus information app called KakaoBus, which is mainly used in Korea.<br/>
You can see busstop information in the header.<br/>
Also if you toggle header's switch, theme change dark mode or light mode.<br/>
And you can see bus arriving information under the header.<br/>
This include favorite button, bus number, bus direction, time left until bus arrive, bus location, seat status and alarm button.
